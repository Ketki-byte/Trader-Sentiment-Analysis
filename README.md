# Trader-Sentiment-Analysis
This project examines the interplay between Bitcoin's Fear/Greed sentiment index and trader performance on Hyperliquid. By merging sentiment data with trader metrics (e.g., PnL, win rates, leverage), it identifies patterns for optimizing trading strategies. Analysis shows superior performance on "Greed" days but riskier behavior on "Fear" days.
